  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>We take the protection of your personal data very seriously. This privacy policy informs you about what data our app collects, how we use it, and what rights you have.</p>

  <h2>What data is collected?</h2>
  <p>Our app measures water consumption by tapping on the screen. No personal data such as name, address, or location is automatically collected.</p>
  <p>We do not store any user data or personal information locally or on our servers.</p>

  <h2>Advertising and Tracking (Google AdMob)</h2>
  <p>Our app uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong>, a mobile advertising service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.</p>

  <p>In this context, the following data may be processed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Advertising ID of the device (IDFA on iOS)</li>
    <li>IP address</li>
    <li>Usage data (e.g. viewed content, ad clicks)</li>
    <li>Device information (e.g. device type, operating system, language settings)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Purpose of data processing</h3>
  <p>The data is used to provide personalized or non-personalized ads, analyze app usage, and measure the reach of advertising campaigns.</p>

  <h3>App Tracking Transparency (ATT)</h3>
  <p>On iOS devices, you will be asked for permission via Appleâ€™s <strong>App Tracking Transparency (ATT)</strong> dialog before the advertising ID is accessed. Only if you agree, the advertising ID can be used for personalized ads. You can withdraw this permission anytime in the <strong>iOS system settings</strong>.</p>

  <h3>Consent SDK</h3>
  <p>In the European Union and other regions where legally required, your consent is obtained via the <strong>Google Consent SDK</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>With consent:</strong> Personalized ads may be shown (legal basis: Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR).</li>
    <li><strong>Without consent:</strong> Only non-personalized ads are displayed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Withdrawal of consent</h3>
  <p>You can withdraw your consent at any time in the app settings or by contacting us. The legality of data processing up to the point of withdrawal remains unaffected.</p>

  <h3>Further information</h3>
  <p>More information on how Google processes data in the context of AdMob can be found here: 
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

    </a>
  </p>

  <h2>Data sharing with third parties</h2>
  <p>Aside from the use of Google AdMob as described above, no other data is shared with third parties.</p>

  <h2>Your rights</h2>
  <p>You have the right to request information about any data we store and can request deletion at any time. Since we do not store personal data ourselves, this usually does not apply.</p>

  <h2>Contact/Support</h2>
